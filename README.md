# Dotfiles

This repository is all my customizations on a linux machine. This is for me and may not be suitable for others. I aim to keep updating this repo as and when I change/add things. 

## Neovim configs
I directly used ![kickstart.nvim](`https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim`) thanks to the authors for such simple starter package. I added additional lsp configs on top. 

## Sway
I use sway window manager. Added configurations for that. I might move to a different one later. I somehow ended up using 2 launcher apps --> Rofi and Fuzzel. I followed some tutorial online for rofi and it has impossible number of files in its configs. SO not adding it. I added Fuzzel which i customized on my own. I will add Rofi in future when I can get my head around to only select relevant files.

## Tmux
Tmux has been an important part of my workflow. I followed `typecraft` youtube for customizations. Thanks to him!


## vimrc
Added simple vimrc in case i need to use it on any machine without nvim. But I mostly use nvim.
